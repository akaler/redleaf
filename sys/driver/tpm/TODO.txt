The TPM uses Hashes to conduct various hash calculations, as it is faster to do large hashing in the CPU.
However, when introducing Hashes to redleaf, we got the following error during build:
``LLVM ERROR: Do not know how to split the result of this operator!''
Based on this Github issue (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/61721), `soft-float` seemed to be cause of the error.
As an temporary solution, we have removed the `soft-float` from `x86_64-tpm.json`.
In the future, we should move the tpm_driver domain somewhere else.
